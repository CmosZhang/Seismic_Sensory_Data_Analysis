# Seismic_Sensory_Data_Analysis
Seismic data reconstruction is an important research direction in the field of seismic signal analysis. The complete seismic data can be used to estimate interior images of the Earth, which can aid the exploration for resources and research in to the shallow structure of the crust for geological and environmental purposes. However, due to the severely corrupted seismic traces and seismic slices, harsh detection conditions, and even financial constraints, seismic data usually has lots of missing data entries and noise. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the robust recovery of seismic data from incomplete and noisy data.
