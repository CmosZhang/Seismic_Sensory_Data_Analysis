# Seismic_Sensory_Data_Analysis
Seismic data reconstruction is an important research direction in the field of seismic signal analysis. The complete seismic data can be used to estimate interior images of the Earth, which can aid the exploration for resources and research in to the shallow structure of the crust for geological and environmental purposes. However, due to the severely corrupted seismic traces and seismic slices, harsh detection conditions, and even financial constraints, seismic data usually has lots of missing data entries and noise. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the robust recovery of seismic data from incomplete and noisy data.<br>

In the Data_preprocessing folder: 
==
The data doesn't work very well when we set the tubal-rank too low during data preprocessing. <br>
When tubal-rank is 15, we can see that the rank approximation result has some new noise.  <br>
When tubal-rank is 32, we can get a good approximation result. <br>

These figures are obtained by running the test_r_error.m in the Data_preprocessing folder.

The figure shows the RSE of the Tubal-Alt-Min algorithm and TNN algorithm for varying frontal slice sampling rates from 80% to 98%.<br>

Two m_files in the error folder:
==
1. Tubal_Alt_Min_error.m is used to calculate RSE in the case of different slice missing. <br>
2. Tubal_TNN.m compared the recovery accuracy and convergence speed between Tubal_Alt_Min algorithm and TNN algorithm. <br>
3. The TNN_solver folder is some functions of the TNN algorithm. <br>

In the Plot_CDF folder:
==

**T_synthetic_tubal_rank_2.mat is a synthetic seismic data set of size: 64 * 64 * 256. Three dimensions are inline,crossline,time respectively.**<br>

**The experimental data of size 326 * 431 * 531. The three dimensions are: time,inline and crossline. tubal-rank: 45.**<br>

**The SeisPlot.zip is the toolbox to plot the seismic data. You should add path in MATLAB after decompression** <br>
